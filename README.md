# EDA-Data-Preprocessing
In this repository, I've conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and pre-processing for numerical, text, and image datasets. This involved data exploration, data cleaning, data visualization, outlier detection and removal, conversion of categorical variables into numerical features, as well as text analysis. For image datasets, I performed various pre-processing techniques, such as color correction, downsampling, color conversion, contrast enhancement, and normalization etc.
All the datasets used in this repository is taken from kaggle website.
